            Based on the website selected, here are the following answer based
            on the promp given. All answer was made reflecting on the

            with the experience?
          </h2>
          <p>
            The first thing that caught my attention on Alan’s website was the
            bold and friendly greeting, “HEY! WELCOME!” was displayed at the top
            of the homepage. It was immediately set to friendly and casual
            greets. The sentence of “Freelance creative front-end developer”
            that shows beneath it makes a highlight of the website. The
            welcoming attitude and introduction of the website's purposes made
            me feel more comfortable and informative.

          <p>
            Reading the homepage greetings and title of each sub page. Viewed
            the navigation menu options on “ABOUT” and “WORKS”. Click on the
            “ABOUT” section and explore more about Alan’s background. Explore
            the “WORK” section for more projects they are working on. Observed
            the “LINKTREE” link under the “FIND ME HERE!” section for online
            social media and pages connection.

          <p>
            I spend the most time on the “ABOUT” page, which provides insight
            into Alan’s skills, professional focus and experience he has. The
            pages were written in a straightforward tone to make me understand
            the background he does. Especially on how he thinks as a developer
            and creative professional designer.

          <p>
            I guess the most common action I performed was navigating between
            the pages and reading all the information provided. The website is
            structured with a single-page experience which gives me smooth
            scrolls between the main parts. It was applied on every page for
            easy navigating and not confusing the readers. I found myself
            clicking through the “ABOUT” and “WORK” sections while reading
            through Alan’s self-description and his part projects.

            interactive experience?

          <p>
            I found the primary goal of Alan’s website is clearly to serve as a
            personal portfolio for him. It was a space where potential clients
            or collaborators can quickly learn about his professional background
            and get in touch with him. The website shows his identity and
            background as a freelance front-end developer and his style of work
            and communication, which helps him to easily reach out to clients.

            goal?
          </h2>
          <p>
            I learned that this website communicates its goal through a
            combination of direct messaging and design simplicity. The headings
            immediately tell visitors who Alan is and what he does. The content
            is minimal but curated to his focus of background, projects and
            connections. It has no distraction and clear messaging for fast
            navigation. Which supports the website’s purpose as portfolio and
            contact point.

            7. What is your impression of how the experience should be
            interacted with over time? (For how long and how many different
            times)
          </h2>
          <p>
            I found that the experience is meant for short and occasional
            visits. Visitors will likely come once or twice depending on their
            purposes. The first visit might be to check out Alan’s credentials
            and possibly again to follow up by revisiting his project portfolio.
            It’s not the kind of site that’s meant for daily interaction, but
            rather for making a strong impression in a brief window of
            attention.

            interested with over time?
          </h2>
          <p>
            I noticed that the website communicates its one-time or
            occasional-use nature through its simplicity and focus. There are no
            blog posts, social media feeds or updated posts that would encourage
            repeat visits. Everything is presented up front and doesn’t suggest
            an evolving or rich content ecosystem. The inclusion of link from
            Linktree helps in providing hints that ongoing engagement might
            happen on other platforms kike social media page or project
            repositories.

            reference?

          <p>
            The website references professional social and creative platforms
            via the Linktree link under the “FIND ME HERE!” section. This
            implies that Alan has a presence on other digital platforms like
            GitHub, Linktree, Instagram and others similar spaces where creative
            and developers tend to showcase work or connection with peoples.

          </h2>
          <p>
            These references suggest that while the main website provides a
            curated snapshot, further exploration or contact should happen
            through external platforms. It implies that I am welcomed and
            perhaps encouraged us to look beyond the site and get a broader view
            of Alan’s work or connect with him more personally or
            professionally.

          </h2>
          <p>
            The reference to social and professional platforms creates a feeling
            of openness and accessibility. It communicates that Alan is
            approachable and available across multiple touchpoints, which adds a
            sense of transparency and encourages informal exploration. It feels
            casual and professional like you’re invited to reach out on your own
            terms.

          <p>
            The most frustrating aspect of the experience is how limited the
            content is. While the design is clean and the message is clear. I
            found myself wanting more details on his website especially in the
            “WORK” pages. It would be great to see more case studies, images or
            explanations of past projects to get a better sense of depth and
            quality of his development work.

          <p>
            I found that the most satisfying part was how immediately clear and
            welcoming that website felt. The bright and cheerful greeting,
            combined with the no-nonsense layout, made it easy to understand who
            Alan is and what he does. It felt like a well-designed digital
            handshake of his background, brief, personal and effective.
